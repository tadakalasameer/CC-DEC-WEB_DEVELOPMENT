The southern zones are the good destinations in the winter months (November to March), as temperatures are mild and game viewing in the national parks will be the best options. Comparatively winter temperatures in the north may become harsh, but this is an excellent time for bird watching, as the migrant species arrive in this period. Summer weather (April to June) in the south is mild and this is the perfect time for beach holiday or cultural tours in this region. Whereas in the north region, summers are an excellent time to visit the Himalayas. Although the temperature will be high, summer is considered a good time for game viewing.';

Like it is a very good idea to lock away your spare currency, traveler’s cheques, passports and precious jewellery in the hotel safe. Moreover, be aware while walking around alone at late night, particularly in the deserted areas or small towns because everything closes early. If possible, avoid travelling late night and never leave your luggage unattended at the airport or train station.";

As Indian landscape is diverse we advise to include the clothes by taking care of the weather and temperature of the area on the particular season. Besides, when visiting religious monuments and shrines you may need to dress formally, so both men and women should pack some long skirts and pants.'
